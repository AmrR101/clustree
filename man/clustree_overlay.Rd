\details{
\strong{Data sources}

Plotting a clustering tree requires information about which cluster each
sample has been assigned to at different resolutions. This information can
be supplied in various forms, as a matrix, data.frame or more specialised
object. In all cases the object provided must contain numeric columns with
the naming structure \code{PXS} where \code{P} is a prefix indicating that the column
contains clustering information, \code{X} is a numeric value indicating the
clustering resolution and \code{S} is any additional suffix to be removed. For
\code{SingleCellExperiment} objects this information must be in the \code{colData} slot
and for \code{Seurat} objects it must be in the \code{meta.data} slot. For all objects
except matrices any additional columns can be used as aesthetics.

\strong{Filtering}

Edges in the graph can be filtered by adjusting the \code{count_filter} and
\code{prop_filter} parameters. The \code{count_filter} removes any edges that represent
less than that number of samples, while the \code{prop_filter} removes edges that
represent less than that proportion of cells in the node it points towards.

\strong{Node aesthetics}

The aesthetics of the plotted nodes can be controlled in various ways. By
default the colour indicates the clustering resolution, the size indicates
the number of samples in that cluster and the transparency is set to 100%.
Each of these can be set to a specific value or linked to a supplied metadata
column. For a \code{SingleCellExperiment} or \code{Seurat} object the names of genes
can also be used. If a metadata column is used than an aggregation function
must also be supplied to combine the samples in each cluster. This function
must take a vector of values and return a single value.

\strong{Colour aesthetic}

The colour aesthetic can be applied to either edges or sample points by
setting \code{use_colour}. If "edges" is selected edges will be coloured according
to the clustering resolution they orginate at. If "points" is selected they
will be coloured according to the cluster they are assigned to at the highest
resolution.
