Description: Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when
    approaching a clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to
    look at how samples move as the number of clusters increases. This package
    allows you to produce clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating
    clusterings as resolution increases.
