# clustree

Deciding what resolution to use can be a difficult question when approaching a
clustering analysis. One way to approach this problem is to look at how samples
move as the number of clusters increases. This package allows you to produce
clustering trees, a visualisation for interrogating
clusterings as resolution increases.

## Installation

You can install clustree from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lazappi/clustree")
```
